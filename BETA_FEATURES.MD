# Leaf PHP Framework v2.0 Beta Features

A lot of changes have gone on in Leaf even since the beta release a month ago, a few additions, changes and removals, however, some of these are incomplete or not production ready, but have been added for 'general' feedback. This is a list of those components

- Leaf Password Helper: **KINDA PRODUCTION READY**. This is a simple helper for passwords which allows you to quickly and efficiently work with password (encrypting, verifying...)

- Leaf Wynter Components: **NOT READY!!**. Wynter is simply PHP-JS. Wynter allows you create reactive components, work with state and other functionality just like with frontend frameworks and libraries like Vue, React...

- Leaf Tokens: **STILL NOT SURE**. This is supposed to be a replacement for JWT.

- Encryption Helper

- Leaf JS Scripts: **WORKS, BUT NOT READY**. Makes using JS in your PHP easierðŸ˜µðŸ¤”. Console log and Localstorage only are currently supported
