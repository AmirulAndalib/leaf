# Leaf 2.0

Leaf is a PHP micro framework that helps you create clean, simple but powerful web apps and APIs quickly.

## Installation

It's recommended that you use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install Leaf.

```bash
composer require leafs/leaf ^2.0
```

This will install Leaf in your project directory.

If you don't want this method, you can simply clone this repo and run `composer install` to download any dependencies. You can then start your server and build your leaf app.

## Basic Usage

This is a simple demonstration of Leaf's simplicity.
After [installing](#installation) Leaf, create an _index.php_ file.

```php
<?php
require __DIR__ . 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Instantiate Leaf
$leaf = new Leaf\App;

// In v2.0, the request and response objects are directly tied to the Leaf Object,
// so you don't have to instanciate them if you don't want to

// Add routes
$leaf->get('/', function () use($leaf) {
    // since the response object is directly tied to the leaf instance
   $leaf->response->renderMarkup('<h5>My first Leaf app</h5>');
});

$leaf->post('/users/add', function () use($leaf) {
    $name = $leaf->request->get('name');
    $leaf->response->respond(["message" => $name." has been added"]);
});

// Don't forget to call leaf run
$leaf->run();
```

You may quickly test this using the built-in PHP server:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

# Working With MVC

Leaf has recently added a new package to it's collection: LeafMVC.
It's an MVC framework built with this package at it's core that let's you create clean, simple but powerful web applications and APIs quickly and easily.

Ckeckout LeafMVC [here](https://github.com/leafsphp/leafMVC)

# Working with API

Leaf also added a simple framework constructed in an MVCish way, but without the View layer purposely for creating APIs and Libraries. Leaf terms this construct as MRRC(Model Request Response ControllerðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…). This let's you seperate API logic, data and "views"(request and response) just like how it's done in MVC.

Checkout the LeafAPI package [here](https://github.com/leafsphp/leafAPI)

Of course, with this core package, you can build your app in any way that you wish to as Leaf contains all the required functionality to do so
